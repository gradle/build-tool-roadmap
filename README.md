# Gradle Build Tool Roadmap

## About this Roadmap

You can see the current projects on our project board:

The Gradle Build Tool roadmap provides a clear, high-level overview of key engineering projects and user-facing features planned for future Gradle releases. Our goal is to offer the Gradle community greater transparency about what to expect in upcoming versions and to illustrate how the tool is evolving to meet users' needs.

Gradle regularly delivers releases packed with enhancements, bug fixes, and new features. Historically, we communicated these changes through [release notes](https://gradle.org/releases/), [blog posts](https://blog.gradle.org/), [issue trackers](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues), [forums](https://discuss.gradle.org/), and [community Slack](https://gradle-community.slack.com/). However, we recognized the need for a more organized and comprehensive overview of whatâ€™s on the horizon. This roadmap addresses that need, providing users with a clearer picture of where the Gradle Build Tool is headed.

The roadmap board is hosted on GitHub and organizes major projects and user-facing improvements by quarter and target release. Each item includes a brief description and links to relevant issues in the issue tracker, allowing you to follow the progress of specific features.

The board also shows the past two quarters so that you can see what we delivered in recent Gradle releases.

Each roadmap item provides a brief description and links to related issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues).

While the roadmap highlights key initiatives, every Gradle release also includes numerous smaller improvements and bug fixes. For a full breakdown of these changes, visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues), [milestones](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/milestones), and [release notes](https://gradle.org/releases/).
